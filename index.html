        Hello! My name is Robert, I'm a developer/systems engineer and my focus is using technology and engineering to solve business problems. As of Fall 2019, I am looking for full time positions in the realm of web development, data science, and operations research. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I am finishing up my senior year at <b>Virginia Tech</b> in the <b>Industrial & Systems Engineering</b> department where I have been cultivating my passions for optimization and design through classes on linear/non-linear programming, human factors, statistics, and industrial process.
      </p>
      <p>
        In industry, I have developed my craft as a full-stack web developer through two great companies, <a class="company" href="https://www.excella.com/">Excella</a> and <a class="company" href="https://www.lightbulbmachine.com/">Lightbulb Machine</a>, and I have written production code in <b>Angular</b>, <b>Vue</b>, <b>React</b>, <b>.NET</b>, and <b>Python</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I excel in roles where work is centered around <b>"why?"</b> questions. Why did we put that button in the right corner of the site? Why do we need an interactive feature on this page? Why should we choose Heroku instead of S3 for hosting? <b>"Why"</b> questions spark my curiosity and lead me to be more productive because I genuinely enjoy those sorts of puzzles. My degree and work experience has helped me as a <b>"how"</b> thinker, because engineering is about figuring "how" to make something work, but "why" is my natural curiosity. 
      </p>
      <p>
